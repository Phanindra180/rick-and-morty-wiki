# Rick and Morty Wiki ðŸ§ªðŸ’¥

This project is a Rick and Morty Wiki. The application consists of a listing of all the series' characters as well as a details page for each one of them. The app also consumes the fantastic [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).

It is built with React, Next, Chakra UI, Apollo and GraphQL.

The app is live on: [Rick and Morty Wiki](https://rick-n-morty-wiki.netlify.com/)
